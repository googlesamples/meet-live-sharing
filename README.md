# Google Meet Live Sharing

## Introduction

**Note:** The Google Meet Live Sharing SDK is in preview. Developers can apply for access through our [Early Access Program](https://developers.google.com/meet/live-sharing/guides/onboarding).

The Google Meet Live Sharing SDK lets you coordinate playback in your application when Google Meet users enjoy video, music, online games, and other activities together.

This app provides a functional example of using the SDK.
